Real-World Application: In-Memory Database Indexing with AVL Tree
In-Memory Database Indexing with AVL Trees – Simplified
 What’s the Problem?
In-memory databases like Redis or MemSQL store everything in your computer’s RAM for speed. But they still need to find and update data quickly.

If they use a normal binary search tree (BST) and the data is added in a bad order (like sorted numbers), the tree can become very unbalanced — like a long chain. This makes it slow, because searching becomes like checking one item at a time.

What’s the Solution?
Use an AVL Tree instead of a regular tree!

An AVL Tree keeps itself balanced automatically by using rotations.

This means it stays "short and wide" instead of "long and skinny."

So, finding or adding data is always fast — it takes logarithmic time (O(log n)), no matter how the data is added.

Why Does This Matter?
Fast searching = faster databases

No slowdown even when the data is added in a random or sorted order

Keeps performance predictable and reliable
Scenario:
Assume we are indexing user records in an in-memory database by user_id. As user records are added randomly, the tree might become unbalanced.
Sample Sequence:
Inserting keys: 50, 30, 70, 60, 80, 55
After inserting 60 and 55, the tree becomes right-heavy:
      50
     /  \
   30    70
        /  \
      60    80
     /
   55
Balance factor at node 70 = +2 (left-heavy), and its left child 60 has a left child (55) → this is an LR (Left-Right) Case.
Applying AVL Rotations:
1.	Left Rotation on node 60 to fix inner imbalance
2.	Right Rotation on node 70 to restore balance
Resulting tree:
      50
     /  \
   30    60
        /  \
      55    70
              \
              80
      50
     /  \
   30    60
        /  \
      55    70
              \
              80
Now the tree remains balanced, and lookup/insertion can be performed in O(log n).

Why AVL Is Ideal Here:
Predictable performance under random insertions

Rotations guarantee minimal height increase

Suitable for systems needing strict real-time performance (like memory-resident databases)

Summary
AVL rotations (especially LR and RL) play a critical role in preserving balance during complex insertions in real-world systems. In-memory databases benefit significantly from such self-balancing tree structures to maintain fast and consistent performance.
