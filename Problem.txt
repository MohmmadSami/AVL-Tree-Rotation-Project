Real-World Application: In-Memory Database Indexing with AVL Tree
Problem Context
In-memory databases (e.g., Redis, MemSQL) rely on fast data retrieval and updates. For indexing internal data structures (such as keys or record IDs), balanced trees are preferred to guarantee efficient operations regardless of insertion order.
A naive binary search tree can degrade to a linked list (O(n)) in worst-case insertions. This severely impacts read/write speeds in live systems.
Solution Using AVL Tree Rotation
To maintain indexing speed, we use an AVL Tree, which guarantees O(log n) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup.
Scenario:
Assume we are indexing user records in an in-memory database by user_id. As user records are added randomly, the tree might become unbalanced.
Sample Sequence:
Inserting keys: 50, 30, 70, 60, 80, 55
After inserting 60 and 55, the tree becomes right-heavy:
      50
     /  \
   30    70
        /  \
      60    80
     /
   55
Balance factor at node 70 = +2 (left-heavy), and its left child 60 has a left child (55) → this is an LR (Left-Right) Case.
Applying AVL Rotations:
1.	Left Rotation on node 60 to fix inner imbalance
2.	Right Rotation on node 70 to restore balance
Resulting tree:
      50
     /  \
   30    60
        /  \
      55    70
              \
              80
      50
     /  \
   30    60
        /  \
      55    70
              \
              80
Now the tree remains balanced, and lookup/insertion can be performed in O(log n).

Why AVL Is Ideal Here:
Predictable performance under random insertions

Rotations guarantee minimal height increase

Suitable for systems needing strict real-time performance (like memory-resident databases)

Summary
AVL rotations (especially LR and RL) play a critical role in preserving balance during complex insertions in real-world systems. In-memory databases benefit significantly from such self-balancing tree structures to maintain fast and consistent performance.
